# Urban sanitation - Citizen workflow for eGovFoundation
As a civil engineer and someone interested in solving tough on-ground problems of India, I discovered the wonderful work being done by [eGov Foundation](https://egov.org.in/).

eGov Foundation is a Omidyar Network backed firm which uses technology to transform urban governance. It builds and deploys DIGIT, an urban governance focused tech stack, in urban local bodies across India. The platform helps digitize processes and increase the efficiency of service delivery.

Having had some prior experience in the area of sanitation, made a presentation on some of the features that could be added for a citizen-friendly online journey.
