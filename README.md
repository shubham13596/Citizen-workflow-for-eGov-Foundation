# Urban sanitation - Citizen workflow for eGovFoundation
As a civil engineer and someone interested in solving tough on-ground problems of India, I discovered the wonderful work being done by [eGov Foundation](https://egov.org.in/).

eGov Foundation is a Omidyar Network backed firm which uses technology to transform urban governance. It builds and deploys DIGIT, an urban governance focused tech stack, in urban local bodies across India. The platform helps digitize processes and increase the efficiency of service delivery.

Having had some prior experience in the area of sanitation, made a presentation on some of the features that could be added for a citizen-friendly online journey.

### Addendum: 
*Some additional ideas I have elaborated below on a) unbundling the components of the current workflow and b) making the entire process digital. 
This idea comes from the implementation of UPI  wherein all ecosystem players take part simultaneously to fulfil the user's request through APIs for a completely digital trail and no manual workflow.*

Currently the sanitation workflow is defined as follows:
1. Citizen raises request on the govt. app built on DIGIT platform
2. The request is registered digitally with the government
3. The government forwards the request to a private vendor
4. The private vendor then sends the truck for sludge collection
5. Payment is made

One of the major reasons people still call manual scavengers today is ease of access. Calling the government agency to have someone come over is time-consuming and is not completely reliable, whereas manual scavengers are easy to find and quick to come when the tank is at the brim and needs immediate cleaning. If those scenarios have to be catered to, the workflow has to be modified to require minimal manual intervention.

### Modified scenarios
Step 1. Citizen raises request on the app
* Can it possible for ULBs to monitor the houses which have septic tanks installed and automatically have a warning issued if a septic tank hasn't been cleaned within a certain timeframe? This would basically involve having a registry of all houses, a flag for the kind of septic tank against them (if there is) and an estimated time of filling up- so that the ULBs are aware of the next cycle of cleaning. 
Such proactive monitoring will avoid situations wherein customer realises of a full septic tank at the last minute and is forced to call manual scavengers.*

Step 2 and 3 - Request is registered digitally and government forwards the request to a private vendor.
* Combining the above two steps, it would be better pvt. vendors were also integrated with the platform. The user can then be shown a listing of potential vendors who can empty the septic tank as part of the workflow. This will allow for competition between vendors to serve in a region improving service in terms of ***cost, speed and reliability*** (all three parameters which heavily affect the choice between choosing a manual scavenger and reaching out to the govt.). Having vendors integrated with the platform  removes step 3. Vendors can bid for the cleaning activity and show a tentative ratecard basis the parameters selected by the user. *

The above steps should allow for true market-making by allowing different players to use the DIGIT platform for the best possible end use. Currently the platform remains narrow in its use-case by not truly allowing all players to participate. Wherein eGov can come in is work with a) ULBs to allow for monitoring of households with septic tanks and b) Work on capacity building of vendors to be able to interact digitally with the platform through APIs.
