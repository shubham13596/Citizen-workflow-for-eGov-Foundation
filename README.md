# Urban sanitation - Citizen workflow for eGovFoundation
As a civil engineer and someone interested in solving tough on-ground problems of India, I discovered the wonderful work being done by [eGov Foundation](https://egov.org.in/).

eGov Foundation is a Omidyar Network backed firm which uses technology to transform urban governance. It builds and deploys DIGIT, an urban governance focused tech stack, in urban local bodies across India. The platform helps digitize processes and increase the efficiency of service delivery.

Having had some prior experience in the area of sanitation, made a presentation on some of the features that could be added for a citizen-friendly online journey.

## Addendum: 
* Some additional ideas I have elaborated below on a) unbundling the components of the current workflow and b) making the entire process digital. This idea comes from the current implementation of the UPI ecosystem wherein during the user journey, all players take part simultaneously to fulfil the user's request through communication via APIs for a completely digital trail and no manual workflow. *

Currently the sanitation workflow has been defined as follows:
1. Citizen raises request on the app
2. The request is registered digitally with the government through the DIGIT platform
3. The government forwards the request either to a private vendor
4. The private vendor then sends the truck for sludge collection
5. Payment is made

From the literature that I have studied and my trips, I realised that one of the major reason for people calling manual scavengers is ease of access. So whereas the village citizen might have to call the government agency to have someone come over, manual scavengers were easy to find and quick to come when the tank was at the brim (in times of emergency). If those scenarios have to be catered to, the workflow has to be such that it requires minimal manual intervention through the entire process.

### Modified scenarios
Step 1. Citizen raises request on the app
Can it possible for ULBs to monitor the houses which have septic tanks installed and automatically have a warning issued if a septic tank hasn't been cleaned within a certain timeframe? This would basically involve having a registry of all houses, a flag for the kind of septic tank against them (if there is) and an estimated time of filling up- so that the next cycle of schedule is notified. 
Such proactive monitoring will avoid situations wherein customer realises of a full septic tank at the last minute and is forced to call manual scavengers.

Step 2 and 3 - Request is registered digitally and government forwards the request to a private vendor.
Combining the above two steps, it would be better if the options to choose from a set of vendors was visible on the app itself during the workflow. This will allow for competition between vendors to serve in a region improving service. TCurrently, users have no visibility into who the vendor can be. One might say that for a user that is not important. But having them on the platofrm removes the step 3 by having that on the platform and unbundling the process. The user can choose from a list of vendors shown to him/her basis the parameters chosen by him/her and depending on the availability different vendors can bid for the activity and show a tentative ratecard basis the parameters selected by the usr

The above steps should allow for true market making by allowing different players to use the DIGIT platform for the best possible end use. Currently the platform remains narrow in its use-case by not truly allowing all players to participate. Wherein eGov can come in is work with the different players to build the platform and help with capacity building of vendors to be able to interact digitally with the platform.
