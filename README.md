# Urban sanitation - Citizen workflow for eGovFoundation
As a civil engineer and someone interested in solving tough on-ground problems of India, I discovered the wonderful work being done by [eGov Foundation](https://egov.org.in/).

Having had some prior experience in the area of sanitation, made a presentation on some of the features that could be added for a citizen-friendly online journey.

Recommendations/comments welcome.
